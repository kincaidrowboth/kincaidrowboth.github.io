My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator at the interface of structural biology, computational biomedicine, and infectious disease. Viruses are relatively simple in the sense that they carry little into the cell but are complex in the way that they manipulate the host's machinery to their bidding. I aim to build a career that leverages multiple data modalities to investigate the complex interplay in the field of infectious diseases.

I am currently a PhD candidate in Biomedical Sciences at the [St. Jude Graduate School](https://www.stjude.org/education-training/predoctoral-training/graduate-school.html), having completed all required coursework and passed my qualifying exam. I train under the mentorship of [Dr. M. Madan Babu](https://www.stjude.org/directory/b/madan-babu.html), a leader in multidisciplinary, structure-focused computational biology, in the Department of Structural Biology.

My research explores how glycosylation motifs emerge and persist on influenza A hemagglutinin, using sequence analysis, structural modeling, and immune accessibility profiling. This work builds upon my previous experience in genomics data and machine learning, extending it into the structural domain.
