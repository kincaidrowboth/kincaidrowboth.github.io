Personal StatementMy long-term goal is to become an independent investigator at the interface of structural biology, computational biomedicine, and infectious disease. Viruses are relatively simple in the sense that they carry little into the cell but are complex in the way that they manipulate the host’s machinery to their bidding. I aim to build a career that leverages multiple data modalities to investigate the complex interplay in the field of infectious diseases. To pursue this vision, I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Sciences at the St. Jude Graduate School, having completed all required coursework and passed my qualifying exam. I am training in the Department of Structural Biology under the mentorship of Dr. M. Madan Babu, a leader in multidisciplinary, structure-focused computational biology.As the first in my family to pursue a PhD, my passion for biomedical research began during my freshman summer as an undergraduate, when I joined the lab of Dr. Barry Milavetz to study epigenetic regulation in Simian Virus 40 (SV40). What started as helping with sample preparation quickly expanded into full experimental workflows and bioinformatic analysis. This hands-on experience sparked my fascination with the hidden logic of biological machinery. Motivated by the possibility of making novel discoveries from different types of data, I also joined the lab of Dr. Xusheng Wang, where I taught myself machine learning techniques and used mass spectrometry data to predict Alzheimer’s progression. Through these early experiences, I came to recognize that many biomedical questions remain unanswered not because we lack the data, but because we haven’t yet developed comprehensive frameworks to interrogate them.Throughout my academic career, I have been drawn to underexplored connections in biological data, not because the data is missing, but because traditional siloed methods often fail to investigate them holistically. I want my research to embody this philosophy. I began graduate training at the University of North Dakota, where I completed coursework and conducted research. I proposed to perform multi-omics data analyses using novel neural network architectures but transitioned to the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences after my lab dissolved due to my PI’s relocation. While UND provided a solid foundation, I sought a program that could better support my evolving vision of integrative, structure-informed computational biology. St. Jude offered precisely that, an environment rich in cross-disciplinary collaboration, advanced computation, and structural biology expertise. I now train in the Department of Structural Biology under Dr. M. Madan Babu, whose mentorship and research philosophy align deeply with my own. My proposed research explores how glycosylation motifs emerge and persist on influenza A hemagglutinin, using sequence analysis, structural modeling, and immune accessibility profiling. This work builds upon my previous experience in genomics data and machine learning, extending it into the structural domain and laying the foundation for a future career as a polymath in computational biomedicine. Through this fellowship, I aim to strengthen my expertise in structural modeling, scientific communication, and mentorship, preparing me to lead innovative research at the intersection of infectious disease and computational tools.B.

Contributions to ScienceUndergraduate Research and Other Relevant Work1. Viral Chromatin Regulation and Epigenetic Remodeling (Milavetz Lab, University of North Dakota)During my early training in the Milavetz Lab, I focused on understanding chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation in the context of Simian Virus 40 (SV40) infection. My work involved chromatin immunoprecipitation, sample quality control, and the development of a new method for identifying histone positioning (FS-Seq). I contributed to multiple peer-reviewed publications exploring SP1 transcription factor interactions and nucleosome architecture in SV40 virions and minichromosomes. Through the ASPET-Surf Fellowship I began to construct a pipeline for more-rapidly processing and visualizing NGS samples in-house using bash and Python scripting. For my Honor’s Thesis work, I investigated in human H1 cell line NCBI chromosome datasets the presence and absence of a variety of histone modifications on RNAPII localization, comparing distance metrics to our findings in SV40. Alongside this work, I taught lab techniques and etiquette to peer undergraduate students (Brienna Hanson and Alezandria Rios Diaz.) This research improved understanding of how SV40 reorganizes chromatin states to regulate replication.* Rowbotham K, Hanson B, Haugen J, Milavetz B.

Machine Learning Applications in Neurodegenerative Disease (Wang Lab, University of North Dakota)In the Wang Lab, I applied machine learning and proteomics to investigate early molecular signals of Alzheimer’s disease. I was the first undergraduate to join the Wang Lab as it was founded in 2020. I developed predictive neural network models using proteomic data, focusing on trajectory inference across disease stages. I led poster and vocal presentations and developed pipelines for integrating biological data using Python and R. In addition to this work I have also explored a plethora of other computational biology research areas as the lab was growing. These included assisting and uploading data from the testing of SMAP: a proteogenomic sample-matching tool, tested and wrote code to make the mass spectrometry data processing JUMP tool-suite cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux.) Additionally, I forayed into predicting cancer types using machine learning methodology and circulating free DNA samples, compared non-coding and coding RNA composition across taxa, and learned to build a Linux server from the ground up to aid in a bioinformatics course taught by Dr. Wang. This work introduced me to high-dimensional inference, large computational workloads, and novel personalized medicine approaches, shaping my current focus on computational biology.* Kincaid Rowbotham, Ling Li, & Xusheng Wang (2021): Building a Path to Early Alzheimer’s Prediction, Poster at UND Summer Research Poster Session 2021* Kincaid Rowbotham, Ling Li, & Xusheng Wang (2021): Building a Path to Early Alzheimer’s Prediction, Poster at ND INBRE Annual Symposium 2021  * Kincaid Rowbotham, Ling Li, & Xusheng Wang (2021): Building a Path to Early Alzheimer’s Prediction, Presentation at Goldwater Symposium 2021* Ling Li, Mingming Nu, Alyssa Erickson, Jie Luo, Kincaid Rowbotham, He Huang, Yuxin Li, Yi Jiang, Chunyu Liu, Junmin Peng, Xusheng Wang: SMAP: A pipeline for sample matching in proteogenomics, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.17.4606826. Mentorship, Outreach, and Undergraduate Scientific Community LeadershipBeyond my research appointments, at my Alma Mater I led multiple campus-wide initiatives to support student research engagement and scientific literacy. As the founder and president of the UND Biology Club (which at the time of my retirement from presidency hosted 71 members), I created a hub for student mentoring, organized seminars with faculty researchers, and with the assistance of UND faculty I helped organize and host North Dakota’s first State-wide Datathon (obtaining sponsorships by Sanford Health and ND EPSCoR),  for which I held workshops on python coding and machine learning fundamentals. Outside institutions, for example, Skaggs school of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences as well as the Xcel Energy STEM initiative, were hosted to spread awareness on scholastic opportunities. As a founding member and administrator of the National Scholarship Peer Advisors (NSPA), I implemented systems to connect students with, and provide guidance on, fellowship opportunities and mentors. Primarily, my goal was to assist students through the application process of national scholarships, by constructing timelines, routine meetings, and providing resources to aid in the application process. These experiences reflect my commitment to mentoring, interdisciplinary education, and equitable access to scientific training.Graduate Research2. Generalizable Neural Network Architecture for Multi-Omics-based Biomarker Discovery (Wang Lab, University of North Dakota)In my continued work in the Wang Lab, I began the construction of a tool that could automatically build and execute an interpretable machine learning architecture for most data modalities using KEGG pathway data. I developed this tool to identify novel biomarkers that traditional differential expression or differential accessibility approaches would not consider, ranking potential biomarkers based on their influence on model’s predictive accuracy as a replacement for ranking based on differing expression levels. This was tested on several data modalities, for example on RNA-seq data for predicting pancreatic cancer as well as TMT-TMT mass spectrometry data for predicting Alzheimer’s Disease. This work was shelfed during the dissolution of the Wang Lab at UND, although I do hope to have a reason to return to this work. Through this experience, I learned how to develop algorithms for interpreting neural network predictions, construct a command line tool interface, and how to construct a tool to handle and process multiple data modalities. 5. Structural and Evolutionary Modeling of Glycosylation in Influenza A Virus (Babu Lab, St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences)As part of my Ph.D. training under Dr. M. Madan Babu, I am using structural and evolutionary frameworks to investigate how Influenza A virus (IAV) adapts under antiviral and immune pressure. My research focuses on two major areas: (1) modeling resistance to Baloxavir Marboxil in the polymerase acidic (PA) protein, and (2) predicting the emergence of N-glycosylation motifs on hemagglutinin (HA). For the Baloxavir project, I contributed to a collaborative study that used induced-fit docking (IFD) to assess how specific mutations in the PA protein reduce drug binding affinity. This work has resulted in a manuscript currently under review in Science Advances. Through this project, I gained experience in protein-ligand interaction modeling, binding energy analysis, and structure-function inference in the context of antiviral resistance. In parallel, my proposed research focuses on forecasting glycosylation motif acquisition in HA by integrating evolutionary sequence constraints, predicting structural models, and glycan accessibility mapping. This work aims to define the mutational pathways and structural limitations that govern glycan site emergence, insights that could improve surveillance and vaccine design. Collectively, this research expands my expertise in protein structure-function prediction, viral evolution, and data integration across modalities. It forms the foundation of my goal to develop predictive tools for viral adaptation and immune escape.D. Scholastic PerformanceNA
